# Project Proposal: Grocery Shopping List App

### Group #8 (group-project-2)

Build an application for shared grocery shopping lists.  Allows consumers to create, view, update and shop from a list of grocery related products using a responsive app that supports web browsers, tablets and mobile devices. With this application, the user/consumer will be able browse and add products to their virtual shopping list. When they are ready to checkout, the consumer can easily move the shopping list items to a shopping cart for checkout. Some of the key must have features of this app:

• Ability to share lists with other people
Our app will make sharing easy with other people (who have different accounts). Sharing means, you can share lists with other user accounts, that you can control which lists are shared, and you can also remove people from your list if needed. Basically, you have full control over what gets shared from within the app. 
• Grocery-specific design
Our grocery shopping app will make grocery shopping easier. For example, the app remembers any items that you enter, allows you to create a list of favorite or staple items, and allows you to group items into categories or sort your list manually. 
o	Add to favorites
o	Assign Store
o	Change Category
o	Move items
o	Copy items
o	Cross-off items
o	Uncross items
o	Delete items
•	Quick entry
When creating a list, it’s important that entry is quick and frictionless. If there are several extra taps involved with adding new items, we consider it a hindrance.
• Basic lists export
In a pinch, we need the ability to send a list through email or SMS, or the ability to print it out.
Future “nice to have” features might include:
•	Picture attachments - Ability to attach an image to an item in the list for easy identification.
•	Coupon compatibility - Ability to look up and use coupons for items on your list.
•	Barcode scanning - Ability to scan a barcode to add or look up an item.

Questions that this application might answers:
• Do consumers prefer grocery apps from retailers vs. CPG brands?
• How would a grocery shopping app assist a consumer with the shopping ritual?
• Do apps that highlight new products and discounts improve the shopping experience?
• How important are app features that improve the pre-purchase activities such as making lists, looking up information, and locating stores?

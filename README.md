# Project Proposal: Health Insurance Marketplace Plan Analysis and Recommendation

### Group #8 (group-project-2)

* Build an application that analyzes the health insurance marketplaces across the US.
* Focus on the impact of age on rates and availability of plans state by state. 
* The user/consumer will provide personal metrics (such as sex, age, and home address) to score and configure a “best case” provider plan recommendation(s) for health and dental plans. 

* Questions that this application might answer:
 
	* How do plan rates and benefits vary across states?
	* How do plan benefits relate to plan rates?
	* How do plan rates vary by age?
	* How do plans vary across insurance network providers?

* Potential Data Used: 
	* Health Insurance Marketplace
	* Data.gov

* Deployed on Heroku
* Database and storage:
	* MySQL
	* FS
* Analytics Package:
	* R or SAS (or some open source analytics package)
